The country has been under a continuous conflict for 40 years and is again at war in 2021 itself. Before this it has been struggling with drought, hunger and along with it, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as well (Ghai, 2021).\n\n\n\nBelow, the analysis is focused on the COVID-19 numbers of 2021 (cases and deaths) and its relation with the on-going crises.\n\n\n\nData Description\n\n\n\nData Source\nThe data set used in this blog has been extracted from World Health Organization-WHO. Which was in-turn collected by WHO via different sources.\nTill 21 March’20, WHO collected these numbers via official ministries of health websites, social media and through official communications under the International Health Regulations-IHR, 2005.\nFrom 22 March’20, WHO collected data through WHO dashboards and counts declared at the WHO headquarters regularly (WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard, 2021).\nVariable description\nThe data set used for the analysis contains the data from January’21 to August’21.

But in May we observe that the cases have rapidly increased whose impact (deaths) is seen in June, and further June having a high crease of cases and gradual decrease till August.\nCOVID-19 statistics highlighted from May’21-April’21.\nHere, the statistics for latest 4 months is highlighted.\n\n\nTT <- Afghan_data %>% \n  group_by(Month) %>% \n  summarise(New_cases = sum(New_cases),\n            New_deaths = sum(New_deaths)) %>% \n  filter(Month %in% c(\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\")) %>% \n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  formattable(list(area(col = 2:3) ~ color_tile(\"#7EDCDE\", \"#7DCEA0\")))\nTT\n\n\n\nMonth\n\n\nNew_cases\n\n\nNew_deaths\n\n\n5\n\n\n12093\n\n\n319\n\n\n6\n\n\n46821\n\n\n1927\n\n\n7\n\n\n28495\n\n\n1837\n\n\n8\n\n\n6066\n\n\n410\n\n\nClearly a high in numbers for cases and deaths is observed in June and July in Afghanistan and a sudden decrease in August.\nConclusion\nIt is evident that by observing the numbers throughout the year, something unusual has happened in Afghanistan after April that has lead to a sudden hike in cases and deaths simultaneously. And this particular event definitely involves crowd gatherings, that being one of the major causes for increase in COVID-19.\nHence, the crises in Afghanistan has caused an impact on COVID-19. As the crises comes to an end in August, we see that the cases and deaths have also dropped significantly from July to August.\nReferences\nCovid19.who.int. 2021.
