# Introduction

Afghanistan is a country located in the south-central Asia. The country has been under a continuous conflict for 40 years and is again at war in 2021 itself. Before this it has been struggling with drought, hunger and along with it, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as well (Ghai, 2021).

Below, the analysis is focused on the COVID-19 numbers (cases and deaths) and its relation with the on-going crises.
