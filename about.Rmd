Hello! and Welcome to my blog. I am Nishtha Arora, a first year masters student of Business Analytics at Monash University, Clayton, Australia. This is my first blog which is a part of a semester 2 assessment. Presently I have been working on academic projects itself and aim to become a full time analyst. My other interests are reading, writing and swimming.

Data, as we know, has the power to define our past, present and future and via this blog, I intend to use data and numbers as my greatest asset to dictate a story. My aim for writing this blog is to spot intriguing subjects in the world and enhance our intuitions, opinions and research using data.

Hope you enjoy reading my blog entries! I am still working on conveying my story in the best way possible, so please email me your suggestions and feedback on: naro0004@student.monash.edu.

Thank you. 

Have a great day!
